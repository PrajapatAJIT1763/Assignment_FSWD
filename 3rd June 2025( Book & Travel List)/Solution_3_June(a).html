            Place Details:
            Jogini Falls is a waterfall with a stream running down to join the river Beas in the Kullu Valley below. It is sacred to the village goddess Jogini & is therefore a place of female power, known as a Shakti Peeth. One can enjoy an energizing dip under these cascading falls while admiring the towering snow clad mountains all around.
            Below the falls there is a small shrine and below that is a Main Shrine (small temple). Villagers go to Jogini Devi to make offerings & to ask for her intercession. As it is such a peaceful, even soporific, sacred place, villagers also go there occasionally to sleep. Special occasions are marked by the cooking of food & the performance of rituals...<a target="_blank" href="https://www.india.com/travel/manali/places-to-visit/waterfalls-jogini-falls/">More</a></p>

Construction started soon after the establishment of the city of Jaipur under the reign of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727. Jaipur remained the capital of the kingdom until 1949—when it became the capital of the present-day Indian state of Rajasthan—with the City Palace functioning as the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. The construction of the Palace was completed in 1732 and it was also the location of religious and cultural events, as well as a patron of arts, commerce, and industry. It was constructed according to the rules of vastushastra, combining elements of Mughal and Rajput architectural styles...<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Palace,_Jaipur">More</a></p>
