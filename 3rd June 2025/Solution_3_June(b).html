        <!-- <p style="color: white; margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 220px; margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 30px;">Beloved is a 1987 novel by American novelist Toni Morrison. Set in the period after the American Civil War, the novel tells the story of a dysfunctional family of formerly enslaved people whose Cincinnati home is haunted by a malevolent spirit. The narrative of Beloved derives from the life of Margaret Garner, an enslaved person in the enslaving state of Kentucky who escaped and fled to the free state of Ohio in 1856.</p>
        <pre></pre>
        <p style="color:white; margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 220px; margin-right: 50px;">Garner was subject to capture under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and when U.S. marshals broke into the cabin where she and her children had barricaded themselves, she was attempting to kill her children—and had already killed her youngest daughter—in hopes of sparing them from being returned to slavery. Morrison's main inspiration for the novel was an account of the event titled "A Visit to the Slave Mother who Killed Her Child" in an 1856 newspaper article initially published in the American Baptist and reproduced in The Black Book, an anthology of texts of Black history and culture that Morrison had edited in 1974. . . <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloved_(novel)" style="color:beige;">Read more</a></p>
